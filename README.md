# Waffles - Strawberries and Cream

From the modder who brought you milkshakes that caused mass lactose intolerance-induced diarrhoea across the Rim, I present to you:
Strawberries and Cream Waffles!

This mod adds a new craftable recreation/luxury food (like chocolate).

### Features

- Strawberries and Cream Waffles

Grants Mood Buff (2) for 18 hours after consumption.

### Balance

A waffle a day keeps the sad away.

### Compatibility

- Compatible as long as you're not lactose intolerant.
- Persons with strawberry allergy should exercise caution.
